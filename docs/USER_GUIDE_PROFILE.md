## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I edit my profile information?
**A:** Currently, profile information can be edited through the member management system by navigating back to the dashboard and editing your member record. Direct profile editing will be added in a future update.

### Q: Why don't I see spouse/children information?
**A:** This information only appears if you're registered as a member (not an admin-only account) and if you have spouse/children information in your member record.

### Q: How often should I change my password?
**A:** We recommend changing your password every 3-6 months or immediately if you suspect it may have been compromised.

### Q: What happens when I logout?
**A:** Logging out clears your session and returns you to the login screen. You'll need to enter your credentials again to access the system.

### Q: Can I delete my account?
**A:** Account deletion must be done through an administrator. Super Admin accounts are protected and cannot be deleted.
