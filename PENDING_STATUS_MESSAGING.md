# Enhanced Pending Status Messaging

## Summary
Added clear, informative messaging to inform users about the pending approval process, expected timeline (24 hours), and notification methods (email/SMS) during registration and login attempts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Register.js - Enhanced Success Message

**Before:**
```javascript
Alert.alert(
  'Registration Successful! 🎉',
  'Your account has been created. Please wait for admin approval before you can login.',
  [{ text: 'Go to Login', onPress: onNavigateToLogin }]
);
```

**After:**
```javascript
Alert.alert(
  'Registration Successful! 🎉',
  'Your account has been created and is currently in pending status.\n\n' +
  '✓ Your registration will be reviewed by an admin\n' +
  '✓ Approval typically takes up to 24 hours\n' +
  '✓ You will receive an email or SMS notification when your account is approved\n\n' +
  'Once approved, you can login with your credentials.',
  [
    { 
      text: 'Go to Login', 
      onPress: () => {
        setLoading(false);
        onNavigateToLogin();
      }
    }
  ],
  { cancelable: false }
);
```

### 2. AuthService.js - Enhanced Pending Login Message

**Before:**
```javascript
if (member.status === 'pending') {
  throw new Error('Your account is pending admin approval. Please wait for approval before logging in.');
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (member.status === 'pending') {
  throw new Error(
    'Account Pending Approval\n\n' +
    'Your registration is currently under review by our admin team.\n\n' +
    '• Approval typically takes up to 24 hours\n' +
    '• You will receive an email or SMS notification once approved\n' +
    '• Please check back later or wait for the notification\n\n' +
    'Thank you for your patience!'
  );
}
```
