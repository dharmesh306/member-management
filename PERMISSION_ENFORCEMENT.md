# Permission Enforcement - Admin vs User Privileges

This document confirms the implementation of role-based access control where **admins can edit/delete all records** while **regular users can only update their own records**.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. Authorization Rules (`src/utils/authorization.js`)

#### Edit Permissions
```javascript
canEditMember(user, memberId)
```
- **Admins/Super Admins**: Can edit **ALL** member records
- **Regular Users**: Can edit **ONLY** their own record (user._id === memberId)
- **Result**: Returns `true` or `false` based on permission

#### Delete Permissions
```javascript
canDeleteMember(user, memberId)
```
- **Admins/Super Admins**: Can delete **ANY** member record
- **Regular Users**: **CANNOT** delete any records (including their own)
- **Result**: Returns `true` only for admins

#### Create Permissions
```javascript
canCreateMember(user)
```
- **Admins/Super Admins**: Can create new member records
- **Regular Users**: **CANNOT** create new members
- **Result**: Returns `true` only for admins

---

## 2. Database Service Enforcement (`src/services/DatabaseService.js`)

### Update Member Protection
```javascript
async updateMember(id, memberData, currentUser = null)
```

**Server-side validation:**
- Checks if user is admin OR owns the record
- Throws error if user tries to edit someone else's record
- Error message: "You do not have permission to update this member"

**Example:**
```javascript
const isAdmin = currentUser.isAdmin || currentUser.isSuperAdmin;
const isOwner = currentUser._id === id;

if (!isAdmin && !isOwner) {
  throw new Error('You do not have permission to update this member');
}
```

### Delete Member Protection
```javascript
async deleteMember(id, currentUser = null)
```

**Server-side validation:**
- Only admins can delete ANY record
- Regular users are blocked from all deletions
- Error message: "You do not have permission to delete members. Only admins can delete records."

**Example:**
```javascript
const isAdmin = currentUser.isAdmin || currentUser.isSuperAdmin;

if (!isAdmin) {
  throw new Error('You do not have permission to delete members. Only admins can delete records.');
}
```

**Additional Protection:**
- Super admin accounts are protected from deletion
- Error message: "This account is protected and cannot be deleted"

---

## 3. UI Enforcement (`src/screens/Dashboard.js`)

### Member Card Rendering
```javascript
const renderMemberCard = ({ item }) => {
  const canEdit = canEditMember(currentUser, item._id);
  const canDelete = canDeleteMember(currentUser, item._id);
  const isOwnRecord = currentUser && currentUser._id === item._id;
```

**Visual Controls:**

#### For Regular Users:
- ✅ **Edit button** appears ONLY on their own record
- ❌ **Delete button** NEVER appears
- 🏷️ **"Your Record"** badge displayed on their card

#### For Admins:
- ✅ **Edit button** appears on ALL member cards
- ✅ **Delete button** appears on ALL member cards (except protected accounts)
- 🎯 No "Your Record" badge (they see all records equally)

**Example:**
```javascript
{canEdit && (
  <TouchableOpacity style={styles.editButton} onPress={() => onEditMember(item)}>
    <Text>Edit</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}

{canDelete && (
  <TouchableOpacity style={styles.deleteButton} onPress={() => handleDelete(item)}>
    <Text>Delete</Text>
  </TouchableOpacity>
)}
```

## 4. Edit Screen Protection (`src/screens/AddEditMember.js`)

### Permission Check on Screen Load
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadCurrentUser();
}, []);
```

**Pre-validation:**
- Checks permissions BEFORE allowing access to the form
- If editing: Verifies `canEditMember(user, member._id)`
- If creating: Verifies `canCreateMember(user)`
- Redirects back with alert if permission denied

### Permission Check Before Save
```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (memberData) => {
  // Double-check permissions before saving
  if (member?._id) {
    if (!canEditMember(currentUser, member._id)) {
      Alert.alert('Permission Denied', 'You do not have permission to edit this member.');
      return;
    }
  }
```

**Dual-layer protection:**
1. **UI Layer**: Prevents unauthorized access to edit form
2. **Save Layer**: Validates permission again before database update
3. **Database Layer**: Final validation in DatabaseService

## 5. User Experience

### Regular User Scenario
```
✅ Login as: dharmesh4@hotmail.com (regular user)
🔍 Search and view all members
👀 See "Your Record" badge on own card
✏️ Edit button appears ONLY on own record
🚫 NO delete buttons visible anywhere
❌ Cannot create new members (no "Add New Member" button)
```

### Admin User Scenario
```
✅ Login as: dharmesh4@hotmail.com (if made admin)
🔍 Search and view all members
✏️ Edit button appears on ALL member cards
🗑️ Delete button appears on ALL member cards
➕ "Add New Member" button visible
⚙️ "Admin Management" button visible in header
🎯 Can approve registrations and admin requests
```

## 6. Security Layers

### Three-Tier Security Model

#### Layer 1: UI Visibility
- Buttons hidden/shown based on permissions
- Users don't see options they can't use
- Clean, intuitive interface

#### Layer 2: Client-Side Validation
- Pre-checks before API calls
- Permission checks in screens
- Immediate feedback to user

#### Layer 3: Server-Side Enforcement
- DatabaseService validates every operation
- Throws errors if permissions violated
- Prevents unauthorized database changes

## 7. Permission Matrix

| Action | Super Admin | Admin | Regular User |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **View all members** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (read-only) |
| **View own record** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Edit own record** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Edit other records** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Delete any record** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Delete own record** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Create new members** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Approve registrations** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Approve admin requests** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Access Admin Management** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |

## 8. Testing the Implementation

### Test as Regular User
```bash
# 1. Login as regular user
# 2. Search for members
# 3. Try to edit another member's record
#    ❌ Edit button should NOT appear
# 4. Try to delete any record
#    ❌ Delete button should NOT appear
# 5. Find your own record
#    ✅ Edit button SHOULD appear
#    ❌ Delete button still should NOT appear
```

### Test as Admin
```bash
# 1. Login as admin (dharmesh4@hotmail.com if granted admin)
# 2. Search for members
# 3. Every member card should show:
#    ✅ Edit button
#    ✅ Delete button
# 4. Header should show:
#    ✅ "⚙ Admin" button
# 5. Can create new members
#    ✅ "+ Add New Member" button visible
```

## 9. Error Messages

### User Tries to Edit Other's Record
```
"Permission Denied"
"You do not have permission to edit this member record."
```

### User Tries to Delete Any Record
```

"You do not have permission to delete members. Only admins can delete records."
```

### User Tries to Create Member

- ✅ Users can ONLY edit their OWN record
- ✅ Users CANNOT delete any records
- ✅ Users CANNOT create new members
- ✅ Three-layer security (UI + Client + Server)
